# Pre-work: Tip Master

Tipster is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: Tasfia Addrita

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if < 10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:
- [x] Replaced segemented control with a slider to provide the user more options for tip percentages.

## Notes

Overall, the pre-work was challenging, since I have never programmed iOS applications. Even though I have programming experience, this exercise definitely proved difficult since I have to not only keep in mind of what I'm coding, but how it affects the graphical user interface (GUI, the storyboard), and vice versa. The 2 hours only reflect on the the time I spent making the gradient background and replacing the segemented control with a slider, as well as the steps outlined in the video provided by CodePath. However, I have spent many more hours attempting to set up the settings view controller and adding more features. I hope to update the app to reflect the optionals and extra features soon.
